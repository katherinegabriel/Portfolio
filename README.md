## About Me

Hi, I'm Kat! I am a rising third year computer science and math major at the University of Virginia. I love programming, and I am especially interested in software development and cybersecurity. I am proficient in Python, Java, C, and SQL, and I have some experience with C++ and JavaScript. 

## Projects

### Bus Lines and Stops of Charlottesville, Virginia

In a software development course at the University of Virginia, I was assigned a project in which I created a database for the bus lines and routes of Charlottesville, Virginia. To create the charts I used JDBC to interact with a SQL database:

### Course Review Application

I, along with a team of other programmers, used JavaFX to program an application used to create and edit reviews for academic courses. We used Hibernate, the Java ORM Framework, to interact with a database that stores courses and reviews as well as user information.

The features of our application include a login window (pictured above), a course search window (pictured below), a course review window, a course add window, and a window containing the user's personal reviews.
